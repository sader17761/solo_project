# Spellbound

Spellbound is an educational spelling application that frees children up to practice their teacher assigned spelling words when they have time.  Using text-to-speech each word is audibly read to the student.  They also have the option to listen to a sentence, part of speech and the definition (utilizing the WordNik api).

#### Note:
The version deployed on Heroku (https://spellbound-soloapp.herokuapp.com/#!/) doesn't allow for the 'part of speech', or 'definition' at this time.  I'm working on fixing this bug.
