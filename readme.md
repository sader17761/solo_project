# Spellbound

Spellbound is an educational spelling application that frees children up to practice their teacher assigned spelling words when they have time.  Using text-to-speech each word is audibly read to the student.  They also have the option to listen to a sentence, part of speech and the definition (utilizing the WordNik api).
