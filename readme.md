# Spellbound

Spellbound is an educational spelling application that frees children up to practice their teacher assigned spelling words when they have time.  Using text-to-speech each word is audibly read to the student.  They also have the option to listen to a sentence, part of speech and the definition (utilizing the WordNik api).

## Why

### Problem/Solution:
I have two elementary boys who bring home spelling words (typically 20 words each) to practice for their upcoming bi-weekly quiz.  The problem is, with my wife and I's schedule, along with our boys after school activities and their daily homework, it's hard to find the time to sit down and study these words with them.

So my solution was to create an application that would allow me as a parent to create these collection of words and allow my boys to sit down when they have time (whether at home or in school) to practice their spelling.

The application also keeps track of their results by logging who took a quiz, which one, when and how well they did, as well as keep track of the words they've spelled incorrectly.  This allows us as parents to keep track of which words are causing them problems.


### NOTES:

Created: July 2017

This was my first MEAN full-stack application.

The version deployed on Heroku (https://spellbound-soloapp.herokuapp.com/#!/) doesn't allow for the 'part of speech', or 'definition' at this time.  I'm working on fixing this bug.
